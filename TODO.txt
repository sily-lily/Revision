# Fix "./scripts/ScramJetInstaller.sh" for Windows, doesn't properly install dependencies.
# After using "./source/clone.js", replace all imports from "./" to "./ScramJet/", probably using regex.
# Add some basic environment variables to add PORT generation.
# Finally, replace the UI files used in ScramJet with our own! We can just use fs.writeFileSync probably..
