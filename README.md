# F.A.Q.
## How's Revision _even useful_?
Revision uses what I call a "dynamic PORT system", which for non-technical people, changes the page you visit Revision on **every 3 visits**, which in-turn, helps void censorship from common extensions like [Securly](https://www.securly.com/) or [GoGuardian](https://www.goguardian.com/).
> **Keep in Mind**: There's also a setting to make it change the URL **every visit**. (Recommended if administrators constantly block the website)

# Usage Guide
1. To use Revision, you **must** have access to a place like: [Repl.it](https://replit.com), [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces), or anywhere else you can host files that'll give you a free domain in return.

2. Revision is self-hosting **only**, we do not provide links for you, simply because administrators can easily block the main URL (Example: **Revision.com**), or only have whitelisted sites, such as [Repl.it](https://replit.com).
