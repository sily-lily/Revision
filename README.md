<h1 align="center">Revision</h1>

An easy to use self hosted [ScramJet](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/ScramJet) based proxy useful for evading internet censorship and getting access to previously restricted websites using a proof of concept port changing design to constantly remain in an unblocked state.

### Installing and Using Revision
Revision is intended to be used in a Linux environment using [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (.sh), however, Windows may work if you have [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) _is recommended_ for self hosting as it serves Revision on a URL with the port built in. Create a new Codespace by clicking the green "**Code**" button, then clicking the plus (**+**) to create a new environment.

Once a new Codespace has been made and you have all of the project files, run the script below to automatically install, update, and run ScramJet with Revision installed.
```bash
bash scripts/init.sh
```
